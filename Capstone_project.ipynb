    "In this project, we want to find out which factor affects on the housing crowded in Chicago. The factors are mentioned by crime rate, number of shop and restaurant, number of schools, distance to the center city. First we have to take data from some sources and clean, normalize. Second, we use the visualization to see the correlation between the percent of housing crowded and each factors. Then we decide which factors are choosen to be the features. Finally by using Regression model, we look for coefficient of each factor and see which is the factor having the most affection of the housing crowded."
